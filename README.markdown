# D3 Scatterplot Graph for fCC

This is a scatterplot graph that shows us all the pro racing cyclists between 1994 and 2015, and whether they were doping or not.

If you point any scatterplot, a tooltip will appear with the following pieces of information :
- the time they took to finish the race,
- the name of that cyclist,
- what year they ran,
- their doping status.

It nice to learn about the scaleTime() function. 
It was fun to notice that almost everybody is cheating in professional racing cyclists' world ^^".
